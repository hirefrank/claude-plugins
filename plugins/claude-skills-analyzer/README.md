- **implementation-guide.md** - Actionable deployment roadmap  
- **skills-analysis-log.json** - Machine-readable data for incremental processing

### Skill Packages
Located in `generated-skills/skill-name/`:
```
skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md           # Main skill with YAML frontmatter
â”œâ”€â”€ reference.md       # Detailed methodology and frameworks
â”œâ”€â”€ examples.md        # Real-world usage examples
â””â”€â”€ templates/         # Reusable output templates
```

**Note**: These directories are automatically created when needed.

## Quality Standards

- **Statistical significance**: Patterns must occur in >5% of conversations
- **Consistency threshold**: 70%+ similarity across instances
- **Time savings focus**: Target >30 min/week automation potential
- **Evidence-based**: Minimum 3 conversation excerpts per pattern
- **Maximum focus**: Generate 5-8 high-impact skills only
