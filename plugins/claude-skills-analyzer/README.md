# Claude Skills Analyzer Plugin

Analyzes your AI conversation exports (Claude, ChatGPT) to automatically generate reusable Custom Skills based on your actual usage patterns.

## Overview

Transform your conversation history into actionable Claude Skills! This plugin performs sophisticated analysis of your AI interactions to identify recurring patterns, evaluate their automation potential, and generate complete, ready-to-use Custom Skills packages.

**Architecture**: Uses a modular design with [shared analysis methodology](./shared/analysis-methodology.md) powering both export-based analysis and tool-based pattern detection.

## Installation

```shell
# Add the marketplace (if not already added)
/plugin marketplace add hirefrank/claude-plugins

# Install this plugin
/plugin install claude-skills-analyzer@hirefrank

# Restart Claude Code to activate
```

## Usage

### 1. Get Setup Guidance

```shell
/skills-setup
```

This command will:
- Create the necessary directory structure automatically
- Walk you through exporting from Claude and ChatGPT
- Explain privacy and security features
- Show you what to expect from analysis

### 2. Export Your Conversations

For detailed export instructions, follow the guidance provided by `/skills-setup` - it will walk you through both Claude and ChatGPT exports step-by-step.

### 3. Run the Analysis

```shell
/analyze-skills
```

Choose from output options:
- **Option A**: Analysis report only
- **Option B**: Complete implementation package (recommended)
- **Option C**: Incremental implementation (top 3-5 skills)
- **Option D**: Custom specification

The analysis will automatically create the `reports/` and `generated-skills/` directories as needed.

### 4. Troubleshoot if Needed

```shell
/skills-troubleshoot
```

Get help diagnosing issues like:
- Missing conversation files
- JSON parsing errors
- Analysis producing no patterns
- Plugin installation problems



## Components

### ðŸ“¦ Commands (Claude Code)
- **`/analyze-skills`**: Export-based comprehensive analysis
- **`/skills-setup`**: Setup guidance and directory creation
- **`/skills-troubleshoot`**: Problem diagnosis and fixes

### ðŸŽ¯ Skills (Web + Claude Code)
- **`workflow-pattern-analyzer`**: Tool-based analysis (Claude Code only - modular)
- **`workflow-pattern-analyzer-web`**: Tool-based analysis (Web + Claude Code - self-contained)
- **`conversation-analyzer`**: Base analysis capability

### ðŸ§© Shared Methodology
All components use the [shared analysis methodology](./shared/analysis-methodology.md):
- 5-dimensional scoring framework (0-50 composite scale)
- Pattern discovery and classification
- Relationship mapping and consolidation
- Prioritization matrix generation
- Quality standards and validation

## Features

### ðŸ”„ Cross-Platform Intelligence
- Unified analysis of Claude and ChatGPT data
- Smart deduplication of cross-platform workflows
- Platform preference insights
- Generates platform-agnostic skills

### ðŸ“Š Statistical Rigor
- 5-dimensional skill-worthiness scoring (frequency, consistency, complexity, time savings, error reduction)
- Pattern validation with significance thresholds
- Evidence-based recommendations with conversation excerpts
- Temporal analysis and usage trends

### âš¡ Incremental Processing (Export Analysis)
- Skip previously analyzed conversations
- Process only new or modified data
- Maintain analysis logs for efficiency
- Build on previous analysis results

## Generated Output

All output is automatically organized in your project directory:

### Analysis Reports
Located in `reports/{timestamp}/`:
- **comprehensive-skills-analysis.md** - Complete pattern analysis with evidence
- **implementation-guide.md** - Actionable deployment roadmap  
- **skills-analysis-log.json** - Machine-readable data for incremental processing

### Skill Packages
Located in `generated-skills/skill-name/`:
```
skill-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md           # Main skill with YAML frontmatter
â”œâ”€â”€ reference.md       # Detailed methodology and frameworks
â”œâ”€â”€ examples.md        # Real-world usage examples
â””â”€â”€ templates/         # Reusable output templates
```

**Note**: These directories are automatically created when needed.

## Quality Standards

All components follow the [shared quality standards](./shared/analysis-methodology.md#quality-standards):

- **Statistical significance**: Patterns must occur in >5% of conversations OR >3 instances
- **Consistency threshold**: 70%+ similarity across instances
- **Time savings focus**: Target >30 min/week cumulative automation potential
- **Evidence-based**: Minimum 2-3 conversation excerpts per pattern
- **Maximum focus**: Generate 8-12 high-impact skills (recommend top 5-8 for initial implementation)
- **No generic patterns**: Avoid broad categories like "writing" or "analysis"

## Example Use Cases

### Business Communication
Identifies email drafting, proposal writing, and client communication patterns.

### Code Review Workflows
Recognizes systematic code analysis and documentation patterns.

### Content Creation
Discovers newsletter writing, blog structures, and social media workflows.

### Research & Analysis
Finds research methodologies and report generation patterns.

## Data Privacy

- **Local processing**: All analysis on your machine
- **No data upload**: Exports never leave your system
- **Anonymized output**: Generated skills remove sensitive info
- **Gitignored exports**: Auto-excluded from version control

## Analysis Approaches

### Export-Based Analysis (Claude Code only)
**Command**: `/analyze-skills`

**Best for:**
- Complete conversation history analysis (100+ conversations)
- Cross-platform analysis (Claude + ChatGPT)
- Incremental processing of large datasets
- Historical trend analysis

**Requirements:**
- Conversation export JSON files
- Claude Code environment

### Tool-Based Analysis (Web + Claude Code)
**Skills**: `workflow-pattern-analyzer` (modular) | `workflow-pattern-analyzer-web` (self-contained)

**Best for:**
- Quick pattern detection without exports
- Web interface users
- Recent conversation analysis
- Iterative skill discovery

- No exports needed
- Uses `recent_chats` and `conversation_search` tools

**Choose your version:**
- **Web Compatible**: [workflow-pattern-analyzer-web](./skills/workflow-pattern-analyzer-web/) - Single file for claude.ai upload
